# ADVENT_OF_CODE_2024
Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place throughout December, featuring a series of daily coding challenges. Starting from December 1st to December 25th, participants solve puzzles that range in difficulty, with each day's challenge being independent of the others.

The puzzles can be solved using any programming language, and the goal is to solve each challenge and track progress through the event. Advent of Code is a fun and educational way to sharpen problem-solving and coding skills, and it's suitable for all skill levels, from beginners to experienced programmers.

This repository contains my solutions to the daily puzzles of Advent of Code.
